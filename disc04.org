* Algorithms
1. FCFS: Lower response, starvation
2. sfs: Starvation
3. Round Robin:
   - If a process finishes early, a new process is put in (even if quantum is not finished)
   - quantum's will start when a new process is put in
   - response: 1st time executed - arrival
   - wait time: finish time - arrival - burst
   - burst time: time it gets on cpu to time to execution finishing
* Contexts switch
| p1 | p1 | p1 | context switch | p2 | ... |
- context switch does not count for the quantums
** Pseudo code:
while !all_done:
    //reached end of quantum
    //dont decrease any p's remaining time
    // care about queue
** We assume we still context switch
* ?
- len_quant; "median"
- "median" of active tasks
- accumulated runtime = Ta = Tburst - Tremaining
whie :
    beginning of context switch
    ta = []
    sort ta's array
    get the median
    for each queue: TA.append(e.Ta)
    round to even when at tiebreaker
